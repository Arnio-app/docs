## <Icon icon="bot" /> AI Chat

**Definition:** The AI Chat handles initial lead engagement by asking qualifying questions, responding to FAQs, and nudging leads toward a booked appointment or human rep.

### Key Capabilities

- Answers common questions (hours, pricing, team, etc.)
- Qualifies leads based on customizable criteria
- Books meetings or escalates to a human if needed
- Operates 24/7 to maximize conversions

### Best Practices

- Use clear, simple language in AI prompts
- Guide the AI with structured flows (e.g. greet â†’ qualify â†’ offer to book)
- Set handoff logic for edge cases and objections

### Example Prompts
