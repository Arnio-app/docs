### Message Structure

- **Hook:** Grab attention (e.g. "Quick question\!")
- **Body:** Share context/value
- **CTA:** Ask a simple, actionable question

### Do’s and Don’ts

✅ Keep messages under 250 characters\
✅ Personalize using lead name/business\
❌ Avoid spammy language (ALL CAPS, \$\$\$)\
❌ Don’t open with a pitch — earn the reply

### A/B Testing

- Test message variations across time, tone, and CTA
- Track open and response rate in analytics

## <Icon icon="message-circle" />How to Get People to Respond to Your Texts

- Act Fast (within 3–5 minutes)
- Responding immediately keeps leads warm and shows professionalism.
- Use Multiple Shorter Messages
- Send 2–3 short messages instead of one big chunk to mimic real conversations.
- Follow Up Strategically
- Keep follow-ups valuable, spaced out (24\+ hrs), and concise. 2–3 follow-ups max.
- Wait to Send Links Until After First Reply
- Avoid spam perception. Links get better previews after the lead replies.

## <Icon icon="message-circle" />"Text Me" Strategy

- At the top of your funnel (ads, site, social: "Want to see it live? Text me").This low-barrier CTA increases engagement and sets you up for a real-time, human-like demo experience.
