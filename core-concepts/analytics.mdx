## <Icon icon="clock-two" /> Average Time to Response

This metric tracks how long it takes your AI or team to respond to incoming messages.

- Lower is better (especially for first-touch replies)

- Helps you optimize response windows and AI timingFor **Cache policy**, select `CachingOptimized` and create behavior.

### `/docs`

The second behavior should be the same as the first one but with a **Path pattern** of `/docs` and **Origin and origin groups** pointing to the same `.mintlify.dev` URL.

### `Default (*)`

Lastly, we're going to edit the `Default (*)` behavior.

<Frame>
  
</Frame>

We're going to change the default behavior's **Origin and origin groups** to the staging URL (in our case `mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app`).

<Frame>
  
</Frame>

Click on `Save changes`.

## Preview Distribution

You can now test if your distribution is set up properly by going to the `General` tab and visiting the **Distribution domain name** URL.

<Frame>
  
</Frame>

All pages should be directing to your main landing page, but if you append `/docs` to the URL, you should see it going to the Mintlify documentation instance.

## Connecting it with Route53

Now, we're going to bring the functionality of the Cloudfront distribution into your primary domain.

<Note>
  For this section, you can also refer to AWS's official guide on [Configuring Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html#routing-to-cloudfront-distribution-config)
</Note>

Navigate to [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) inside the AWS console, and click into the `Hosted zone` for your primary domain. Click on `Create record`

<Frame>
  
</Frame>

Toggle `Alias` and then **Route traffic to** the `Alias to CloudFront distribution` option.

<Frame>
  
</Frame>

Click `Create records`.

<Note>
  You may need to remove the existing A record if one currently exists.
</Note>

And voila\! You should be able to have your documentation served at `/docs` for your primary domain.
