  ### Additonal Texting Capabilities

  - **Send File Attachment:** You will soon be able to attach and send files (PDFs, images, etc.) through the iMessage interface in Replyblue. Perfect for sending quotes, product brochures, and service confirmations.
  - **Send Voice Memos:**  Users will be able to record and send voice messages directly from the dashboard, making cold outreach and follow-ups feel more personal.
  - **Send Emojis in Text:** Lightweight, human-friendly emoji support is coming to make conversations more engaging and expressive. Just type as you normally would, and emojis will render natively.

  Add visibility into message delivery and read status. Includes:

  - Read Receipts
  - Delivered/Failed Message Status
  - Timestamps per message
