## Step 1: Enable AI Replies

- When adding a new contact, you can enable AI by toggling the **“Enable AI”** switch during creation.

For existing contacts, open the conversation thread, click the slider icon on the top right to view contact details, and toggle **“Enable AI”** from there.

Once enabled, your AI will begin responding to new inbound messages automatically.

<Tip>
  You can disable AI at any time on a per-thread basis.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Configure Response Behavior

- Go to the Automation tab in your dashboard.
- You'll see **AI Reply Time:**
  - **Response Delay (in mintues)**  

      Simulates real human typing speed. We recommend 2-3 mins.

## Step 3: Train Your AI with Prompts

Replyblue uses dynamic prompt training to make your AI sound like you.

**To set it up:**

1. 1. Navigate to **AI Prompt Trainer** (inside Settings or Tools tab).
2. 2. Fill out the**fields:**
   - **Our Company Description** – e.g. "We help auto dealers sell more vehicles via text"
   - **Common Questions Customers Ask** – e.g. "What’s the price?", "Is this still available?", "Can I come see it today?"
   - **How You Want the AI to Respond** – tone, format, length, escalation rules
3. Click **“Submit”** to apply the updates instantly.

<Tip>
  The more detailed your prompts, the more natural your AI becomes.
</Tip>

### ⚙️ Optional: Set Hand off Rules

You can define when the AI should **stop replying** and notify a human. Example conditions:

- When the lead asks to talk to a person  
- When the conversation includes certain keywords (e.g., “call me” or “speak to someone”)  
- After the AI has replied 3 times and no response
