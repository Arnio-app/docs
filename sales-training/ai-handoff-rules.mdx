## <Icon icon="shuffle" />  AI Handoff Rules

**Definition:** Handoff rules determine when the AI stops responding and transfers the conversation to a human.

### Common Handoff Triggers

- Lead requests a human (e.g. "Can I speak to someone?")
- AI receives a response it doesn't understand after 2 attempts
- Lead meets qualification thresholds (e.g. high intent)

### Customizing Handoff Logic

- Set intent detection for escalation phrases
- Define confidence thresholds for fallback handling
- Route to specific reps based on team/region/specialty

### Handoff Tagging

- Tag conversations as `handoff-ai`, `qualified`, or `needs-review` for CRM visibility
