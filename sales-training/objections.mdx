## <Icon icon="alert-triangle" /> Handling Objections

**Definition:** Train the AI and team to respond effectively to common objections during sales outreach.

### Common Objections
- "I’m not interested"
- "Too expensive"
- "Not the right time"
- "We already use a tool for this"

### Response Framework (A.R.E.)
- **Acknowledge:** "Totally understand"
- **Redirect:** “Out of curiosity, what are you currently using?”
- **Explain:** Share quick benefit or differentiator

### AI Implementation
- Load objection keywords into fallback logic
- Pre-script soft, respectful rebuttals with clear exits
