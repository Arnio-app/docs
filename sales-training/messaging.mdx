### Message Structure

- **Hook:** Grab attention (e.g. "Quick question\!")
- **Body:** Share context/value
- **CTA:** Ask a simple, actionable question

### Do’s and Don’ts

✅ Keep messages under 250 characters\
✅ Personalize using lead name/business\
❌ Avoid spammy language (ALL CAPS, \$\$\$)\
❌ Don’t open with a pitch — earn the reply

### A/B Testing

- Test message variations across time, tone, and CTA
- Track open and response rate in analytics

- Act Fast (within 3–5 minutes)
- Responding immediately keeps leads warm and shows professionalism.
- Use Multiple Shorter Messages
- Send 2–3 short messages instead of one big chunk to mimic real conversations.
- Follow Up Strategically
- Keep follow-ups valuable, spaced out (24\+ hrs), and concise. 2–3 follow-ups max.
- Wait to Send Links Until After First Reply
- Avoid spam perception. Links get better previews after the lead replies.

Why it Works:
Captures attention: People are still thinking about your product or service.
Builds trust: Quick replies imply high-quality support.
Positions you ahead of competitors: Many businesses wait much longer—so you stand out by being prompt.

## <Icon icon="message-circle" />" 1. Use Multiple, Shorter Messages" 

Rather than sending a single, blocky text, try splitting your thoughts into two quick messages. Why? It feels more personal and less automated. It also nudges the recipient with two notifications instead of one, doubling the chances they’ll notice you.

‍Example Flow:
Message 1: “Hi Taylor, thanks for reaching out!”
Message 2: “Do you have a moment to discuss the pricing options?”
This approach mimics a natural conversation style. People text like this with friends, so a string of two or three short messages can feel more human than a single oversized chunk.

- More messages do not always equal more responses. Overdoing it can make you look spammy or desperate. Instead, plan each follow-up to add context or value, referencing what you sent before or addressing a potential question.

‍Best Practices for Follow-Ups:
Space them out: Give your leads some breathing room—24 hours or more if they haven’t responded.
Keep it concise: A simple check-in is often enough.
Limit your attempts: After two or three follow-ups without any response, it may be time to step back and rethink your outreach strategy or channel.

- At the top of your funnel (ads, site, social: "Want to see it live? Text me").This low-barrier CTA increases engagement and sets you up for a real-time, human-like demo experience.

 Why Delay the Link?
Builds trust: You show you’re focused on genuine conversation first.
Increases clicks: Eye-catching previews on iOS devices stand out in the chat.
Prevents spam vibes: You avoid the immediate red flag of an unsolicited link.
We'll start by setting up a Sendblue client in our workspace. This will allow us to send arbitrary messages from anywhere in our codebase. We'll also set up a webhook to receive status updates for Stripe Subscriptions.

## <Icon icon="message-circle" />"Final Thoughts"

- Getting people to respond to your texts takes more than just hitting “send.” By reaching out quickly, using multiple short messages, being thoughtful in your follow-ups, and saving links for when your lead is already engaged, you’ll give your texting strategy the best shot at success—without overwhelming the conversation. Test these tips, monitor your response rates, and continue to refine your approach for maximum impact.

Happy texting—and here’s to higher response rates!
